# 🚀 SpamShield: Sentiment & Spam Detection System

SpamShield is a **full-stack chat moderation system** that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to detect spam and analyze sentiment in real time. It’s designed to help platforms maintain clean, positive user interactions and is adaptable for **healthcare comment streams** or other sensitive domains.

---

## 🛠️ Features
- ✅ **Spam Detection:** Classifies messages as spam or non-spam using ML models.
- ✅ **Sentiment Analysis:** Detects positive, negative, or neutral sentiment for moderation insights.
- ✅ **LLM Integration:** Leverages GPT for advanced contextual understanding in moderation.
- ✅ **Full Stack Architecture:** Microservices backend (Python Flask) + React.js frontend dashboard.
- ✅ **Serverless Deployment:** Runs on AWS Lambda for scalability and cost efficiency.
- ✅ **Real-Time Processing:** Handles thousands of messages/hour with low latency.
